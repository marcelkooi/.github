`tier` is a tool that lets you define and manage your SaaS
application's pricing model following best
[PriceOps](https://priceops.org) practices.

Tier helps you to define a single source of pricing truth that
can be safely and easily updated, with a simple json definition
optimized for SaaS use cases. This keeps everything aligned as
you find the best product-market fit.
